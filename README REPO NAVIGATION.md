# first_projects
Repository for projects done during bootcamps.

For Projects 1, 2 and 3, we were given a pre-structure of markdown cells with steps and titles.
Project 4 onwards, it was completely up to us to build the project from scratch. We were given instructions on the project and project objective, but nothing more.
